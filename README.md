# Darmok

## Name

As tradition begs me, this is a reference to something from star trek.  I am learning language design, that episode is about communication and language.  Thus Darmok.  Go watch star trek the next generation.

## Point

To learn about parsing/lexing and interpreting/compiling.

I'll do types later I guess, they seem hard.
